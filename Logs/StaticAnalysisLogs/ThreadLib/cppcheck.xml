        <error id="cstyleCast" severity="style" msg="C-style pointer casting" verbose="C-style pointer casting detected. C++ offers four different kinds of casts as replacements: static_cast, const_cast, dynamic_cast and reinterpret_cast. A C-style cast could evaluate to any of those automatically, thus it is considered safer if the programmer explicitly states which kind of cast is expected.
