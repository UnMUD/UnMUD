        Said Ged, 'I do not know, for the interconnections of its chambers are
        most intricate.  Perhaps we should ask Tedd, the Zen Master of Aber.'
        So they did.
        Said Ged, 'Oh wise and most learned Tedd, how can one find one's way
        through the treacherous maze of the catacombs?'
        Said Tedd, ' One can't.  Send Ned.'
        And suddenly Cedric and Ged were most pleased, for Tedd had shown them
        the path to enlightenment.

The journal seems to belong to Dinthiar, the elven king.  It speaks of what
has happened to this once beautiful land.  It seems that there were two
great evils, who had been engaged in an eternal war with each other.  They
had shifted from world to world, leaving each one a desolate ruin behind
them.  Sadly, one day the two evils came down upon this beautiful realm.
Here, their last battle was fought.  One of the two, a demon of great power,
still resides in the caves to the west, lording over the land he helped
destroy.  The other, a deathless lich, was forced to flee.  It is rumored
though, that he still hides somewhere in these lands.  Dinthiar believes
that the elven lands can still be restored.  What is needed is a great hero
to vanquish the two ancient evils...

The runes also allude to a spell for summoning people, SUMMON, but
note that several amulets and talismans can protect the victim from
its effects.
        A spell for finding the exact locations of players, objects
and mobiles, WHERE, is also mentioned.

book <null> 48 925 925 -1 0 0 -1706 0 0 0 0 0 200 10 12
A heavy iron bound book has been left here.^
^
^
^
The book details many arcane and powerful magic, mostly to cause
 severe pain to other beings.  In a flowing hand is written:

Fireball
        A potent piece of magic much dependent upon the power of the caster
        as to the damage it does, although sulphur enhances this.
Missile
        A similar magic, much popular amongst mages.  It is said that magical
        talismans may be created to aid this spell.
Shock
        A spell of touch, which can pass through metal armors with great ease.
        A decent caster never uses this as a party trick.
        Lodestones help with its casting.
Frost
        A spell similar to a fireball in power. A direct hit will slow
        your opponent down and make his aim less sure.  It is said that
        wintergreen will enhance this spell.

Any mage should beware that casting magic, though potent, will drain the
strength of the caster.
