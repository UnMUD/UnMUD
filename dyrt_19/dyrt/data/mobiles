Puff the Fractal Dragon is here with a faraway look in her eyes.^
You examine Puff more closely.
Puff is big, purple, and stupid-looking.  You can tell that she uses only
a very small fraction of her brain.  As you look into her vacant eyes you
sense that this is a creature that would never harm so much as a flea on
purpose.  You can tell, however, that when provoked, she would make a
strong adversary.
