hall s:green;
lflags { Party Peaceful RealTime }
The Town Hall^
   You are in an older wooden building that serves as the Town Hall of
Miller's Corners.  The floor underneath you is wood and creaks as you
move around.  The room you are in is not very large, and there are a few
doors that seem to lead to meeting rooms.  The building looks like the 
type of place where a town council would hold its meetings.  Off to one
corner is a long wooden table where many people can sit.  The floor around
it is well-worn and you guess that this building gets a lot of use.
^
/* 2 */
green s:smith n:hall e:road1e w:road1w;
lflags { Outdoors RealTime }
The Village Green^
   You are standing on a large green just south of the Town Hall.  The
buildings of the town seem to kind of surround this green, which serves
many purposes among the people of the town.  To the south is the Blacksmith's
shop.  There is a path running from east to west through the green that 
leads west to the sea and east to the rest of the village.
^
/* 3 */
smith n:green;
lflags { RealTime }
The Blacksmith Shop^
   The room you are in is dark and hot and smells of steam, fire, and hot
iron.  There is a large forge in the center of the room that seems to put
off quite a lot of heat.  There are tools that the Smith made for himself
lying nearby.  The Smith seems to be making a set of horseshoes for a 
horse that you can hear whinnying in an attached stable.  There is a large
collection of horseshoes hanging on a beam above the forge.
^
/* 4 */
road1w s:bank e:green w:road2w n:oldwell;
lflags { Outdoors RealTime }
The Village Path^
   Here the path starts to climb to the west.  You can just barely make
out the tops of the tall ships harboured at the shipyard.  The path climbs
west to the open sea, and slopes down to the village in the east.  To the
southwest is a large mill and just to the north, a very old well that looks
like it hasn't been used in years.
^
/* 5 */
bank n:road1w;
lflags { RealTime }
The Bank^
   You are in a little town bank where the village people can deposit and 
withdraw money.  The bank will also make loans to the people of the village.
The building itself is small and somewhat more modern-looking than the
other main buildings in the village.
^
/* 6 */
oldwell d:downoldwell s:road1w w:shipyard;
lflags { Outdoors RealTime }
The Village Well^
   This well apparently hasn't been used in quite some time.  Looking down
it you can see that the well is dry and about five feet down, someone has
blocked the well off with a sturdy metal grate.  The old well cover is lying
nearby; made of a wood that has bleached in the sun.
^
/* 7 */
downoldwell u:oldwell;
lflags { RealTime }
The Village Well^
   You decide to lower yourself into the well and down onto the metal grate.
The grate seems to be sturdy as you test it out with one foot and then the
other.  You set both feet down on the grate and relax your grip on the well.
You study the make of the well, which seems to be made of large pieces of
impermeable rock.  The well itself looks deep, but you can't really guess
its depth, as there is complete darkness below.
^
/* 8 */
road2w e:road1w w:jetty n:shipyard s:mill;
lflags { Outdoors RealTime }
The Village Path^
   You are on an incline just east of the village jetty.  The hill you are
on seems to grow right up to the water and then cut off in a cliff.  Thank
goodness the hill isn't much higher than sea level.  To the north is the 
shipyard, while to the south is a large lumber mill.
^
/* 9 */
mill n:road2w;
lflags { Outdoors RealTime }
The Lumber Mill^
   The operation that is set up here is a primitive sort of wood mill.  This
is a place where the people of the village can come to buy wood to make houses,
furniture, and many other things that they might need.  The wood supplies are 
brought into the harbor and cut to the customer's specifications at the mill.
The floor is very dusty and you sneeze a lot as you move around.  The floor
beneath you echoes to your footsteps.
^
/* 10 */
shipyard s:road2w e:oldwell;
lflags { Outdoors RealTime }
The Shipyard^
   You are moving among many tall ships that are anchored in the harbour.
There seems to be a lot of shipping activity in the area.  Some of the ships
are much larger than others, but they are all made of wood and very finely
crafted.  One of the particularly beautiful ships that catches your eye seems
to be called "Susan".  Some of the boats closer to and on the shore seem to
have been there for quite a while.  There is a tiny boat on the shore that
seems to have sailed its last voyage and is now bleaching in the sun.
^
/* 11 */
jetty e:road2w d:under;
lflags { Outdoors RealTime }
The Jetty^
   You have reached the high point of the hill and are standing on a 
type of wooden boardwalk, overlooking the sea.  There is a brisk, warm
breeze here that feels refreshing as it blows across your face.  Beneath
you, the hill drops out into the water, which beats against the dirt with
an incredible rate.  There is a little path beside the boardwalk that leads
down to a dry patch of sand below the jetty.
^
/* 12 */
under u:jetty e:^outerdoor;
lflags { RealTime }
Under the Jetty^
   Under the wooden platform of the boardwalk above, you are standing on a
sandy strip of beach that is rather hard and packed, as though it is
often covered with water.  The wall under the jetty is made of stone to
prevent dangerous erosion.  Holding up the sea side of the boardwalk are
five tall and stately wooden poles, each covered in sea slime up to about
four feet.
^
/* 13 */
hidden w:^innerdoor;
lflags { RealTime }
Secret Storage Room^
   Prying the metal sheet off of the stone wall that holds up the jetty, you
go into a rather dark and dank storage room underneath.  The room seems like
it hasn't seen the light of day in a very long time.  There are spiders 
crawling here and there, but they seem to be the only form of life that has
seen this place in many many years.  There is nothing particularly special
about the room.  It is carved into the hillside and was probably used
as a secret storage place long ago for pirated goods.  Way off to one corner
are the remains to what used to be a wooden chest.
^
/* 14 */
road1e w:green e:road2e s:inn n:newwell;
lflags { Outdoors RealTime }
Village Track^
   You are to the east of the village green, off of which are the main
administrative buildings of the town.  The track you are on is of hard
packed dirt and extends east and west from here.  To the east is another
path leading to the north that seems to lead to the village shops.  Off
to the west, the landscape rises and then cuts off sharply into the sea.
Just to the south is the entrance to the Village Inn.  To the north is 
a small village well; apparently still in use.
^
/* 15 */
newwell s:road1e;
lflags { Outdoors RealTime }
The Village Well^
   The well you are standing next to seems to be much newer than the one
west of the town hall, and seems to still be in use.  This well is not
blocked off and seems to go quite a distance into the ground.  You can
hear the slight sounds of water moving below.  The well is covered which
makes it difficult to see down into it, but you can guess the depth.
Somehow you think that climbing down into the well would be unwise.
^
/* 16 */
downnewwell;
lflags { Dark }
The Village Well^
   Ignoring all general rules of safety, you decide to be adventuresome 
and lower yourself into the well.  At first you keep your hands on the
top of the well for a good grip,but as the well seems to be fairly dry,
you press your hands and feet against opposite walls and work your way
down into the well about 7 feet.  You take your left foot one more step
down, and suddenly the well isn't so dry anymore.  You lose your footing
on some slime and fall into the well below.  

			AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!

					SPLASH!!


You find yourself sitting on your butt in about a foot and a half of water.
What do you do now?
^
/* 17 */
inn n:road1e e:bar;
lflags { RealTime }
The Village Inn^
   The lobby area of the inn is rather nice.  There are several plush chairs
set up for people to sit in while they wait, or read the paper, or whatever
they wish to be doing.  The place is simple but tastefully decorated, and
seems to be reputable.  In the back, a door leads up the stairs to what
you believe to be rentable rooms.  To the east is another doorway that leads
into the bar.
^
/* 18 */
bar w:inn n:road2e;
lflags { RealTime }
The Village Bar^
   The bar is a dark and smokey place.  You take your place at a stool at
the bar, which is well-grooved from many years of use by passing sailors
and travelers alike.  The bar seems to serve a wide variety of drinks,
and you settle down with a beer.  Looking around the room, you see local
men drinking with their friends after a hard day's work, as well as a number
of people who, from their shyness, you guess aren't from around here. 
Yet another group of sailors is being rather rowdy at a table nearby.
^
/* 19 */
road2e s:bar n:road1n w:road1e e:road3e;
lflags { Outdoors RealTime }
The Village Track^
   This part of the path runs right by the steps to a local bar.  At this
point the east-west track through the village forks to the north, where
several small shops seem to be set up.  The heart of the village is to 
the west.
^
/* 20 */
road1n s:road2e n:road2n;
lflags { Outdoors RealTime }
The Village Path^
   You are on a north-south path that meets with an east-west path just to
the south.  On this street are many of the merchants of the village.  Here
you can find a weaponsmith, locksmith, a general store, and an armorer.
^
/* 21 */
road2n s:road1n n:road3n w:weapons1 e:armor;
lflags { Outdoors RealTime }
The Village Track^
   You are standing just outside the weapon shop, which is to the west, and
the armor shop, which is to the east.  To the north the street continues to
other shops and back to the south the street joins the rest of the village.
^
/* 22 */
weapons1 w:weapons2 e:road2n;
lflags { RealTime }
The Weapon Shop^
   The waiting room you are standing in displays many kinds of weapons made
by the weaponsmith who owns this shop.  He seems to be skilled in many
types of weapons; even some you don't recognize.  You can hear him working
away in the back room. 
   The little door that allows you to go behind the counter is open.
^
/* 23 */
weapons2 e:weapons1;
lflags { RealTime }
The Weapon Shop^
   Now you are near the forge where the weaponmaster makes his items.  As
you watch the smith work, you are amazed at his skill.  The room you are in
is rather dark and hot, but it is interesting to watch the smith work.
^
/* 24 */
armor w:road2n;
lflags { RealTime }
The Armor Shop^
   In the waiting room you have entered, there are various pieces of armor
hanging on the walls. standing on the floor, and resting on tables.  They
all seem to be under the watchful eye of the armorer sitting in the back
so you don't dare try to take any of them.  Behind a counter is the work
area.
^
/* 25 */
road3n n:stream s:road2n e:genstore w:locksmith;
lflags { Outdoors RealTime }
The Village Road^
   You have reached the northern end of this street.  Beyond, to the north,
there is a river bank, and beyond, a large prairie filled with nothing but
tall grass.  On the other side, in the distance, you can see some incredibly
large mountains.  They seem to be at their most impressive off to the 
north-east.  
   To the west is the locksmith's and to the east is the General Store.
The main part of the village is back to the south.
^
/* 26 */
locksmith e:road3n;
lflags { RealTime }
The Locksmith's^
   Here, the locksmith makes keys and locks for anyone who wants one.  The
smith himself seems to be at work on a particular key behind the counter.
All around you are examples of his work, including a huge key hanging on
one of the walls that seems a bit frivolous, but perhaps it serves some 
purpose of which you are not yet aware.
^
/* 27 */
genstore w:road3n;
lflags { RealTime }
The General Store^
   The store is small and quaint but seems to have just about anything a
person could need.  The store sells food supplies, containers, guns,
fabric, and hundreds of other little necessities.  There are also several
items in the store that are not necessities but appear to be interesting
imported little items such as dolls and toys. 
^

The Village Path^
   The east-west path that you are coming into town on widens a bit here.
The path is more definite and you can see buildings in the west.  All around
you are homes of villagers.
^

lflags { Outdoors RealTime }
The Village Path^
   The path through the prairie that you are on seems to widen ahead to
the west.  On in the distance you can make out some buildings, while all
around you, villagers' homes are scattered.
^

lflags { Outdoors RealTime }
The Path^
   The path that you are walking on through the prairie meets with a few
scattered homes ahead, and seems to widen off to the west.  Way off in
the distance there are some buildings that seem to belong to some small town.
^
/* 31 */
road6e w:road5e e:road7e;
lflags { Outdoors RealTime }
The Prairie^
   You are on a thin path through a field of tall grasses.  To the west, you
can just make out the homes and buildings which would point to a small
village.  To the east, the grasses meet with a moor.
^
/* 32 */
road7e w:road6e e:11@MOOR;
lflags { Outdoors RealTime }
The Field of Grass^
   You are in a field of tall, blowing grass.  Leaving the area of the
moors, the ground becomes more solid, and there is even a thin path
leading to the west. 
^
/* 33 */
stream w:stwest1 e:streameast s:road3n;
lflags { Outdoors RealTime }
By the Stream^
   The stream you are standing by could more likely be considered a small 
river.  The water is moving quite fast, and you feel that it would probably
be unwise to attempt to cross it.  The stream seems to flow from the 
north-east and the water is cold.  The water carries on to the west, where
it seems to pick up speed and get louder.
^
/* 34 */
streameast w:stream;
lflags { Outdoors RealTime }

You are moving upstream toward the east.  Here the river bends and seems to
flow on, finding its source high in the majestic mountains to the north.
Every once in a while, you think you hear a loud noise coming from the
distant mountains.
^
/* 35 */

lflags { Outdoors RealTime }
By the River^
   The river is getting ever faster as you head down-stream.  The scenery
on the opposite side of the river is as breath-taking as ever.  The 
mountains you can barely make out are snow-capped; probably year-round.
Every once in a while, you think you hear a loud noise coming from that
general area, but you can't be sure.  The prairie grass on the other side
is teeming with life of all kinds.  The sun above is shining bright and
reflecting off of the river's water.  The noise you hear coming from the
west seems to be getting louder and louder.
^

   Here the river is so loud you can hardly hear yourself think about

that you must be coming along a waterfall.
^

At the Waterfall^
   Beyond you to the west is one of the most breath-taking sights you have
ever seen.  Here the river gets white and foamy as it cascades down a
waterfall.  Hitting the river below with tremendous force, the whole area
is alive with the sound of flowing water.  Not too far away this rushing
water joins the open sea in an eroded inlet.  There is a rocky path leading
down dangerously close to the waterfall.

On the Rocky Path^
   Where you are standing on the path, you are so close to the water that
 you can feel yourself being sprinkled upon by mist from the waterfall.
The noise around you is deafening.  Fortunately the water is far enough 
away that it is not drenching the path upon which you are walking.  Slowly
you can work your way down the path.

   You slowly work your way down to the bottom of the path.  You are

   You step behind the water's flow and find yourself in an naturally

coming up from underground and entering the sea to join the waters of
the waterfall.
