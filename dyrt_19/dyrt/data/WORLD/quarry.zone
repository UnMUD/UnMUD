lflags { RealTime Outdoors }
Steep Drop^
   You are following a path which plunges steeply downwards into a narrow
quarry, which stretches out to the east.
^
/* 2 */
2 e:7 s:3;
lflags { RealTime Outdoors }
Quarry North^
   You are at the north end of the quarry.  The quarry extends away to the
south.  To the east a small battered stone hut appears to have once served the
workmen's needs.
^
/* 3 */
3 n:2 e:4 w:1 u:1;
lflags { RealTime Outdoors }
Quarry South^
   You stand at the southern end of the quarry.  To the north the sides of the
quarry are marked by years of excavations. A path to the west climbs steeply up
amongst the stones.  It appears some mining was in progress here as there is a
low tunnel to the east.
^
/* 4 */
4 w:3 d:5;
lflags {RealTime NoMobiles }
Tunnel^
   You are crouched in a low damp tunnel.  A single exit leads west out of the
tunnel.  A treacherous wooden ladder leads down into the darkness below
^
/* 5 */
5 e:6 w:4 d:9;
lflags { Dark }
Ladder^
   You are standing at the bottom of a treacherous wooden ladder.  Another
ladder descends yet further through the floor of the rough-hewn tunnel you find
yourself in.  The tunnel leads east.
^
/* 6 */
6 w:5;
lflags { Dark }
Tunnel's End^
   You are at the end of a small tunnel, at what appears to be an abandoned
face.  The only way back is westwards.
^
/* 7 */
7 w:2;
lflags { RealTime }
Stone Store^
   You are in a cold, damp stone store, which was evidently warm and cosy at
one time.  The store appears to still be used by someone, as there are marks on
the floor.
^
/* 8 */

lflags { Death }
Mineshaft^
   The rungs break beneath your feet and without a chance to recover you plunge
helplessly into the black cold water below...
^
/* 9 */
9 e:10 u:5;
lflags { Dark }
Bottom Of Ladder^
   You are standing at the bottom of a long wooden ladder which travels upwards
through a square shaft in the roof.  The tunnel you are standing in leads
eastwards.
^
/* 10 */
10 w:9 d:11;
lflags { Dark }
Mine Tunnel^
   You stand at the eastern end of a narrow mine tunnel.  Apart from scrambling
back westwards along the tunnel, a narrow wooden ladder exits downwards through
a shaft at your feet.
^
/* 11 */
11 u:10 d:12;
lflags { Dark }
Ladder^
   You are scrambling down a ladder which descends through a narrow vertical
shaft in the rock.  Water streams down the sides of the ladder making it
slippery and dangerous.
^
/* 12 */
12 e:13 u:11 d:14;
lflags { Dark }
Ladder Ledge^
   You are standing on a narrow wooden ladder which plunges deep into the
ground.  A single narrow and very roughly hewn passage leads east off the
side of the ladder.
^
/* 13 */
13 w:12;
lflags { Dark }
Rough Face^
   You are crouched in a narrow passage, at what appears to have been a face
of some sort.  To the west is a huge wooden ladder which plunges down deeper
underground, as well as climbing upwards towards the surface.
^
/* 14 */
14 d:15 u:12;
lflags { Dark }
Ladder^
   You are standing on a wet slippery ladder that plunges down a narrow mossy
shaft deep underground.  The air is already noticeably colder and you feel
closed in and claustrophobic.
^
/* 15 */
15 u:14 d:16;
lflags { Dark }
Ladder^
   You are hanging onto a vertical wooden ladder, slippery with damp and hard
to grasp with your wet cold fingers.  All around you the narrow tight walls of
the shaft seem to press crushingly inwards.
^
/* 16 */
16 u:15 d:17;
lflags { Dark }
Ladder^
   You are in a narrow constricting vertical shaft, hanging onto a cold and
rotting ladder.  The walls are damp and wet, and you too are also soaking and
cold.  Your numb fingers are finding it hard to keep a grip on the ladder, and
your feet slide off rungs with frightening regularity.
^
/* 17 */
17 w:18 u:16 d:18;
lflags { Dark }
Bottom Of The Mine^
   You are standing at the bottom of a treacherous ladder which climbs up a
narrow vertical shaft.  To the west you can crawl along a low, heavily shored
up tunnel towards a face.  Another ladder leads further down, but it is rotted
and descends only about ten feet before it disappears into the flooded depths
of the mine.
   To judge from the moss and slime on the wall, this part of the mine is often
flooded too.
^
/* 18 */
18 e:17;
lflags { Dark }
Narrow Face^
   You are crouched at a narrow face deep in the mine.  The low roof and tight
rough walls seem to be closing in on you, and you shake as you think of the
huge weight of rock above your head.  A single crawl leads east to a ladder.
