   You are standing on the wooden planking of the main deck of a large pirate
ship.  A mast climbs into the sky, atop of which you can see the crow's nest.
The deck leads around the ship.  North to the forward end of the ship, south

Foredeck of the Ship^
   You are standing on the deck at the bow end of the pirate ship.  Cannon
emplacements line the sides, and a small pile of cannon balls is beside each
cannon.  A small hatchway leads down into what is apparently the hold, and  a
small plank leads out over the ocean to the east.  Around the ship, you see
clear blue water, infested with man-eating sharks.

   You are in the ship's hold, apparently just a rather large, open space.  It
is immediately obvious that the pirates have transported a large variety of
objects in their ship, for you see everything from scraps of cloth to animal
droppings littering the floor.  To the south, a large door leads to the rest
of the ship.

Ship's Mess^
   You are in a large room with several long tables.  Sawdust covers the floor,
and scraps of food litter both it and the tables.  Smokey light streams in 
from several portholes lining the walls, but it does nothing to lighten the
mood of the place.  A small doorway leads off to the west, a hallway extends
to the south, and a large door stands in the middle of the north wall.
^

The Galley^
   You are standing in the middle of the cramped room that serves as the ship's
kitchen.  Lining the walls are pots, pans, and other kitchen utensils.  A
small stove sits in one corner of the room, amid sacks of flour, sugar, and
pepper.  The only exit to the room is in the east wall.

Crew's Quarters^
   You are in a small room, lined on two walls with bunk beds.  You see all
sorts of carvings in the wood walls, which were probably made by idle sailors
with large knifes.  You see a small table made out of a barrel and a wooden
panel.  A doorway is in the east wall.

Captain's Quarters^
   You are standing in what is obviously the captain's room.  It is lushly

the north, a door opens out onto the deck.

White Beach^
   You are standing on a pure sand beach, blindingly white. Pounding waves

and the beach continues to the north.

   You are standing in front of a large, pillared archway. In between the
pillars you see a hazy cloud, through which the moors can be seen. This is
strange though, for when you look behind the archway, all you can see is a
large cliff, at the bottom of which you can see waves crash. A path extends
off to the north here, winding down the side of the volcano.

Shore of the Lagoon^
   You are on the shore of a lagoon that fills the center of the extict

crystal clear, You can make out some sort of submerged building. A small set

palm trees, and the path extends off to the north.

   You are standing amid the pews in the main room of the temple. Murals of
hobbits in a number of activities cover the walls, giving the room a cheerful
appearance. On the altar at the front of the room is what appears to be the
remains of food, apparently some sort of offering to the Gods. Exits lead to
the east, south, and west.

High Priest's Quarters^
   You are in what was once the home of the high priest, but is now the lair
of the mermaid. Various trinkets of the surface world line the room for
decoration, and a soft bed of seaweed is in one corner. At the north end of
the room, a large arch is built into the wall. Through the haze that fills
the center of the arch, you can make out a clearing in a forest. A doorway 
leads back into the altar room to the east.

Small Storage Room^
   You stand in what used to be a small, unremarkable store room. It is barren
except for a stairway leading up into an air-filled chamber, and a doorway
leading to the north.

Accounting Room^
   You are in a room that through some miracle is still full of air. Though
stale, it appears to be breathable. A small desk is in shambles in one corner
of the room, and papers lie everywhere. There is a doorway to the west, and
stairs lead down into water.

Temple Treasury^
   You stand in the temple's treasure room. Rotted foodstuffs are scattered
across the floor, but other than this room is bare. A doorway to the east
is the only way out.
