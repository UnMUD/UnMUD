Bones w:Silent@Church d:^BonesStairs;
lflags{Dark}
Old Bones^
   This musty chamber is cluttered with old bones and scraps of clothing.
Your footsteps stir up the thick dust choking you with its dry bitter taste.
No treasures remain, having long ago been looted by barrow robbers.
^
Plain w:River u:^PlainStairs;
lflags{ }
Gloomy Plain^
   You are standing at one end of a vast underground plain. A murky orange glow
dimly illuminates this place. A narrow path has been worn into the gray dust of
the plain, which wends its way westward between scattered clumps of withered
plant life.
^
River n:Rocks e:Plain w:Charon u:Rocks;
lflags{ }
Banks of River Styx^
   You stand on the bank of a river that cuts through the plain. The river is
foul and murky. Behind you to the east a path crosses the barren plain and
above you to the north is a mound of rocks. To the west a boat sits on the
river, waiting patiently.
^
Rocks s:River d:River;
lflags{ }
In the Rocks^
   This mound of rocks could have been the ancient remains of a watchtower
that afforded a good view of the river. The far bank looks even more desolate
and forbidding than the near one, it is probably a good thing that the river
separates them. Up river, to the north, the current is much swifter as it
gushes through a rocky narrow canyon. To the south the river wends it way
slowly out of sight.
^
Charon n:Creek e:River s:Styx;
lflags{ }
Charon's Boat^
   You stand on Charon's boat at the edge of the River Styx. The boat is
actually little more than a raft propelled by polling it along the slow
current. From here you could return to the eastern bank, though you get
the feeling that few passengers do. Charon is not here now, but there is
a collection box with a coin slot in it.
^
Creek;
lflags{Death}
Up the Creek^
   The current is too swift here for safe navigation.
Oh, dear you seem to be up the creek without a paddle...
^
Styx s:Stop;
lflags{ }
On the River Styx^
   You are moving slowly down the River Styx. The water gives off a foul odor
and looks just as bad. It appears to boil in places and its color is a mixture
of grayish brown and yellow. Even though the water moves slowly here, movement
upstream would be impossible without supernatural help.
^
Stop w:Abyss;
lflags{ }
Last Stop^
   The boat seems to pull up to the western bank of the river and stops.
On the bank is a sign that reads:

       Last Stop.
       Everyone Must Disembark.

As you get off the boat, it pulls away, returning whence it came.
^
Abyss e:Stop d:Stairs;
lflags{Dark NoMobiles}
The Abyss^
   You are at the face of an enormous curved basalt cliff that extends down
out of sight into a dark pit. A small sign, hand painted in blood, tells you: 

     Mortals keep out!

A black door set into the face of the cliff has a dark arrow above it pointing
down. A sign pasted on the door informs you the elevator is out of order.
For those hearty souls, a large, circular stairway has been carved into the,
cliff face, allowing you to make the long descent into the black pit.
^
Stairs u:Abyss d:Stairway;
lflags{Dark}
Top of Stairway^
   The inky darkness closes in on you here as you wend your way around the
basalt face of this enormous abyssal pit. The stairway seems to go on forever
as it descends to the lowest levels of the Abyss.
   A construction sign here informs you that the first 661 levels are closed
for repairs... looks like you're in for a long walk.
^
Stairway u:Stairs d:L662;

Abyssal Stairway^
   You seem to be nearing the bottom now, but having lost track of how far
you have come, you can't be sure. It looks like as good a place as any to rest.

   You stand at the entrance to the 662nd level of the Abyss. A tunnel has
been bored into the western face of the pit.
^

lflags{Dark}
Level 663^
   You have reached the entry to the 663rd level of the Abyss. A tunnel has
been bored into the eastern face of the pit. A sickly green goo seeps slowly
from the tunnel, making the stairs here slippery.
^
L664 w:^L664Door u:L663 d:^L664Rope;
lflags{Dark}
Level 664^
   Nearly at the bottom now, you have made it to the 664th level of the Abyss.
In the western face of the pit is a heavy iron door with a massive lock.
A sign on the door announces:  None shall pass.
   A large gap in the stairs, where something or someone has smashed through
them, prevents you from going further down.
^
L665 n:Netherhells u:^L665Rope d:L666;
lflags{Dark}
Level 665^
   This is the next to last level of the Abyss. Below you, you can just make
out the floor of the Abyss. To the north a tunnel has been bored into the rock.
Words cut into the rock next to the entry remove all doubt who dwells here:

       I, Guxx Unfufadoo, rule this region
       soon your head I'll be a squeezin'

A gap in the stairs above you prevents you from going up.
^
L666 s:Bottom u:L665;
lflags{Dark}
Level 666^
  At last, the end of the stairway. This is the 666th and final level of the
Abyss. A deep sense of foreboding comes from an archway to the south.
^
City e:^CityWeb d:Head;
lflags{ }
Web City^
   You are standing among a cluster of boulders high up on one side of a
large cavern. The other side of the cavern is filled with giant spider webs.
Below you the cavern is split by a gaping chasm. A path winds down from here
toward a bridge, which spans the chasm.
^
Head n:Wicket u:City;
lflags{NoSummon}
Bridge Head^
  This is the southern end of a bridge, which crosses a dark chasm. The bridge
is made of spider webbing, but is far from fragile. The main cables supporting
the bridge are as big as a man's forearm. It's enough to make you wonder what
kind of spider could make such silk.
^
Wicket n:Tunnel s:Head u:Ledge;
lflags{NoSummon}
Stickey Wicket^
   The spider webs cover everything here. If you were a spider, it would would
be easy to get around, otherwise the only way you could go and not get caught
in the webs is northward, into a dark smelly tunnel. You could also climb up a
single strand of webbing that hangs down directly over the tunnel. Or you could
cross the bridge back to the south.
^
Tunnel n:Web s:Wicket;
lflags{Dark NoMobiles}
Stinky Tunnel^
   The tunnel here feels close and uncomfortable. The air is filled with the
stench of filth and decayed remains which wafts from a very narrow shaft in
the side of the tunnel. To the north the tunnel widens into a room and a sense
of great evil comes from that direction.
^
Web n:Lolth e:Eastside s:Tunnel w:Westside;
lflags{Dark}
Demon Web^
   You are in a pocket at the center of a particulary large system of webs.
At the center of the room is a large black altar. Fresh blood drips from the
altar, forming a pool at its base and from there runs toward a large archway
to the north. Smaller archways lead east and west.
^
Pile u:Widow;
lflags{Dark}
Husk Pile^
   Decayed filth coats the floor here and overpowers you with its odor.
Web enshrouded husks of various creatures, some of which are the remains
of humans, are piled underneath a shaft in the ceiling.  
^
Lolth s:Web;
lflags{Dark NoSummon}
Lolth's Lair^
   Uh, oh... this isn't Kansas anymore Toto. You have stumbled onto the lair
of the Demon Queen of Spiders. Darkness prevails here. Even the strongest
light source can illuminate only a small portion of this chamber. A touch
of the wall nearest you reveals a sticky substance and you are standing in
a pool of warm liquid.
^
Eastside w:Web;

Eastside Room^
   This is a small room used by the Demon Queen's attendants to rest between
sacrifices. It is barren, cold and dark.

   You have reached a small ledge high above the tunnel entrance. A thick
coating of dust covers everything here. A low tunnel leads north.

Widow s:Ledge d:Pile;

Widow's Lair^
   This is where the Black Widow makes her home. Her latest conquest hangs
from the ceiling in a cocoon of silk. From a dark shaft at your feet comes
a stomach turning odor.
^
Slimy n:Trees w:^SlimyBoulder;
lflags{ }
Slimy Bank^
   You are standing on the western bank of a river of slime. The slime level
is high here and some of the goo occasionally slops over the bank and runs
down toward a tunnel in the earth to the west.
^
Trees n:Bank1 s:Slimy;
lflags{ }
Broken Trees^
   The north-south path you are following runs through a stand of willow
trees that have been blown over and smashed. Fungi of all kinds are growing
on the downed trees and their stumps. The ground is blanketed with moss.
^
Bank1 e:^Bank1Timber s:Trees d:Goo;
lflags{ }
West Bank^
   You stand on a high bank overlooking a slow moving river of slime.
The opposite bank is too far away to jump across. A path runs south from here
along the river, and a slope has been cut into the bank, leading right down to
the river.
^
Goo s:Downstream u:Bank1;

   The current is getting swifter as it pushes you up to the east bank of
the river, allowing you to climb out. Further down, the river seems to boil.

   The river is moving very fast now and begins to spin in a circle,
sucking you down. You are soon drowning in snot...

   You are on the eastern bank of a river of mucus. The ground is soft and
squishy here and someone's or something's footprints can be seen heading south.
^
Boggy n:Bank2 s:Swamp1 w:Downstream d:Downstream;

   The ground gets softer the further south you move along the mucus river.
In that direction you see a stand of trees partially obscured by mist.
The river runs right up to the bank here, allowing easy boat launching.
^
Swamp1 n:Boggy e:Swamp2;
lflags{Dark Peaceful NoMobiles }
The Swamp^
   You are at the edge of a vast swamp. The tall trees here are laden with
moss hanging all the way to the surface of the swamp. Thick mists obscure
vision, making it hard to find your way. The ground is most firm to the east.
^
Swamp2 n:swamp1 e:swamp4 s:swamp5 w:swamp3;

Demon's Vault^
   This place has an unnatural, sepulchral quietness to it. The ceiling of the
vast chamber is supported by regularly spaced massive columns. The columns
are carved with the contorted faces of demons. The ground, dry and dusty, is
littered with dead leaves, which flutter slightly in an occasional light
breeze.

can be seen a large palatial room.

piled high with unopened mail. There is an exit to the west and a black
door to the south. The door has a dark arrow above it pointing up and a
small green button beside it.

   You are in a small enclosure without features save a large red button.
You hear Van Morrison singing in the background.

Control Room^
   A large table dominates this room. On the table are charts, maps and
various scraps of vellum that detail the construction of a new world.
A piece of slate has been mounted on the back wall and on the slate are
strange formulae written with colored chalk.

An Angel's Treasure^
   This room is devoid of anything except a large icebox. There is a note
attached to the icebox door that reminds you to buy more Mountain Dew.

Closet^
   The faint smell of mothballs can be detected as you look about this rather
spacious closet. A torch here has long since burnt out and the place is totally
empty. Above you and just out of reach is a shelf.  There appears to be
something on the shelf.

Secret Room^
   You have entered a secret storage chamber behind the closet. The walls
are paneled in aromatic cedar and a single torch is mounted on the far wall.
Beneath the torch sits a small high desk cluttered with scraps of paper.
In the back corner is a coat rack.

On the Shelf^
   You are squatting on large wooden shelf high up in the closet. It doesn't
seem to get much use as everything is covered with a thick coat of dust that
threatens to make you sneeze.
