Grove s:Valley@Blizzard u:Tree1 d:^TopFoxHole;
lflags{Outdoors}
Oak Grove^
   Deep in the oak grove, you find yourself surrounded by silent trees in a
field of frost-covered grass.  Two stone lions crouch before you, flanking an
immense oak with heavy, low branches.  A lush valley extends to the south.
^
Tree1 u:Tree2 d:Grove;
lflags{Outdoors}
Oak Tree^
   You are sitting comfortably in the fork of a big branch.  The branches are
spread out high over your head.  The sun shines through the leaves, so that you
must shade your eyes with your hand to look up.
^
Tree2 n:Elm d:Tree1;
lflags{Outdoors}
Oak Tree^
   You are high up, near the crest of the oak tree.  You can see the branches
of an elm tree to the north, almost touching the oak.  Farther away, the tops
of the trees thin out into little terraced fields propped by stone walls, and
groves dark with olive trees and walnuts.  In the distance is the sea where a
boat is idly sailing.
^
Elm n:Fig e:Mulberry s:Tree2 w:Walnut;
lflags{Outdoors}
Elm Tree^
   You are in an elm tree, high above the ground.  This is not an easy tree to
move about on as the branches grow upwards, slender and thickly covered,
leaving little foothold.  To the north you can see the twisted shape of a fig
tree, to your west is a knobby walnut, and to your east is a mulberry.  In the
south are the oaks, haughty and detached.
^
Mulberry e:Magnolia w:Elm;
lflags{Outdoors}
Mulberry Tree^
   Some branches of the mulberry tree reach and overhang a high fortress-like
wall to your east.  Over the wall you can see a magnolia, from whose black
branches spring pulpy white flowers and shiny dark leaves.
^
Magnolia e:Bedroom w:Mulberry d:Gardens;
lflags{Outdoors}
Magnolia Tree^
   The branches, although they are slender and of soft wood, bear your weight,
and the points of your shoes tear white wounds on the black bark.  You are
enveloped in the fresh scent of leaves, turned this way and that by the wind,
dull one moment and glittering the next.  Quite far below the lowest branch is
a mysterious garden, and to the east, a half-hidden mansion.  One high window
is quite near your tree.
^
Bedroom e:Landing w:Magnolia;
lflags{}
Mansion Bedroom^
   This looks like a little girl's bedroom.  An arched doorway leads east.
The room is beautifully furnished with curtains of white taffeta, a Persian
carpet, and a tiny canopied bed with cushions of pale yellow damask.  Rosewood
chairs surround a tiny silver table, with a doll's tea service set for two.
^
Landing s:^window_landing w:Bedroom d:mansion;
lflags{}
Mansion Landing^
   You are standing in a great pool of colored light, cast by the stained glass
of a vast coat of arms in a south-facing window, depicting an heraldic leopard.
To your west is an arched doorwary.  A huge, curving marble staircase extends
downwards into the mansion, past paintings and stern-looking busts.  You have
an uncontrollable desire to slide down a banister.
^
Ilex n:^window_ilex;
lflags{}
Ilex Tree^
   In the ilex, deep in the thickest press of leaves, you find a hanging
pavilion with curtains flapping in the wind, shaded by a large, fringed
parasol.  Stuck on the branches here and there are fluttering ribbons and
scraps of lace.  Butterflies dart in pairs among the curtains.
^
Mansion w:Entrance u:Landing s:Library;
lflags{}
Mansion^
   Here in the mansion, silver shines and lacquer glows, carved gilt chairs
line the walls, sofas have legs like swans' necks and rest on lions' paws, and
a great deal of dust spirals slowly through the air, lit by innumerable softly
glowing candles. A marble staircase curves upwards, and you can see the gardens
through a doorway to the west.  To the south is the mansion library.
^
Library n:Mansion;
lflags { }
Mansion Library^
   You are standing in the mansion's large library.  It has many famous pieces
of writing.  Among the more famous works are stories by Mark Twain, William
Shakespeare and many others.
^
Gardens e:Entrance;
lflags{Outdoors}
Mansion Gardens^
   In the gardens the branches spread out above you like the tentacles of
extraordinary animals, and the plants on the ground open up stars of fretted
leaves like the green skins of reptiles, and wave feathery yellow bamboos with
a rustle like paper.  A white flight of stairs leads east to the mansion. Above
you is a sweet-scented magnolia tree, but the lowest branch is too high for you
to reach.
^
Entrance e:Mansion w:Gardens;
lflags{}
Mansion Entrance^
   You are standing on a small white porch.  A white flight of stairs lead west
to the gardens.  The mansion door is to your east.
^
Fig n:Olive s:Elm;
lflags{Outdoors}
Fig Tree^
   You are in a fig tree, under the pavilion of leaves, watching the sun move
slowly through the network of twigs and branches, smelling the scent of flowers
budding in the stalks.  The fig tree seems to absorb you, permeate you with its
gummy texture and the buzz of hornets, and you feel uneasy.  To the north is a
small olive grove.
^
Olive e:Oaktree17 s:Fig w:Olive2;
lflags{Outdoors}
Olive Tree^
   You find that the olive trees make comfortable and easy passages for you, in
spite of the scarcity of thick branches.  The grove extends to the east and
west.
^
Olive2 e:Olive s:Olive3;
lflags{Outdoors}
Olive Tree^
   This tree is hung all over with scrawled pieces of paper and bits of
cardboard with maxims from Seneca and Shaftesbury, and with various objects:
clusters of feathers, church candles, crowns of leaves, women's corsets,
pistols, scales, tied to each other in a certain order, the significance of
which has been lost.  The olive grove continues to the east.

   In this tree there is a kind of hanging bookcase, sheltered somewhat from
the rains.  The olive grove continues to the north.

Olive Tree^
   This tree juts out from a cliff, and through the leaves and branches you
find the sea there facing you, calm and limpid and vast as the sky. The horizon
opens wide and high and the sea-blue is stretched bare, without a sail. You can
almost count the far-off ripples of the waves.  Only a very light rustle, like
a sigh, runs over the pebbles on the beach.  There are some roots hanging over
the cliff face here.  They look fairly sturdy, and you might be able to climb
down if you weren't carrying much.

Walnut Tree^
   You are in an old and stately nut tree.  At the fork of the trunk is a
hollow, formed from an old ax wound.  A soft boarskin is stretched across the
hollow, making a cosy refuge in the shade of the dark green foliage.  In a deep
incision in the bark, now so old and deformed that it no longer seems the work
of human hands, is carved in big letters: Cosimo, Viola, and beneath: Ottimo
Massimo.

Fox Hole^
   You have crawled into a damp, narrow fox hole.  The roots of the giant oak
are all around you.  The burrow continues to the south, but the fox smell is
stronger there.

   You are crawling around on your hands and knees in a cramped north-south fox
burrow.  The stench of fox permeates the burrow and gets even stronger towards
the south.  The air to the north is somewhat fresher.

Fox Den^
   You are wedged into a reeking fox den.  Strangely enough, the vixen has
built her den adjoining a huge natural cavern that extends deep into the earth,
much farther than your feeble flame can penetrate.  It looks like it might go
all the way to China!  You could jump in, but you would fall a long way....
There is a blinking construction sign here.

Side of the Cliff^
   The roots end here and you are hanging precariously to the side of the
cliff.  You catch a glimpse of a hole behind the thick roots.  It's a tight
squeeze, but you could probably make it.  Getting back, however, is impossible.

Behind the Roots^
   You are in a cramped underground tunnel.  A myriad of roots dangling from
the ceiling keep you from standing up straight.  From the northern end of the
tunnel, light streams down a low incline, dimly illuminating the tunnel.  It
feels as though someone is tapping you on your shoulder, but when you turn
around no one is there.

The Incline^
   This is a low incline dug from the earth.  By the looks of the deep claw
marks in the walls, it was dug by some animal.  On one area of the wall the
marks resemble words.

Sunny Clearing^
   You find yourself in a large clearing amongst the trees.  The sun shines
brightly throughout the trees here.  One particularly intense sunbeam shines 
upon a large rock near the northern end of the clearing.  At the southern end
you can make out neatly trimmed hedge rows, while a narrow path snakes through
the clearing from east to west.  A sloping hole has been dug out of the earth.

Beneath the Olive Tree^
   The light is much dimmer here, as the branches almost completely block out
the sun.  The grass is neatly trimmed and it's obvious that someone takes
proper care of these groves.  The only exit lies to the west.

The Shrubbery^
   The hedges are neatly trimmed shrubberies.  One is a little higher than 
the others and produces a nice tier effect with a path running down the middle.
Someone certainly must care for the plants in this area.

   The path ends here at a large oak tree.  The giant oak completely blocks the
path, creating a dead end.  On either side of the oak tree are large statues of
magnificent lions.  One of the lions has its mouth open.

   The air seems heavy, almost wooden, and gray mists prevent you from seeing
more than two feet in front of you.  You have to grope around before finding
a way out to the north.

The Great Forest^
   You stand on a low hill overlooking a vast forest that looks truly primeval
in nature.  Some of the trees look as tall as a giant.  Below you, you can hear
the wind softly moaning through the trees.  Or is that the wind?

Entrance to the Sacred Grove^
   The trees thin somewhat here, and you can hear strange sounds from all 
around you.  It smells of cedar and the floor of the forest is littered with a
thick bed of pine needles.  East of here you can make out what looks to be a
small clearing.

Sacred Grove^
   A sense of power radiates from the centre of this clearing where bolts of 
lightning frequently flash from a lowering sky.  Strangely enough these bolts
make no sound.  In fact, you hear nothing at all, as everything has fallen
silent about you.

The Crack^
   This is a tight squeeze, and you frequently have to scramble over large 
rocks that partially block the way.  The walls are sharply chiseled and cut 
into your skin now and then as you try to squeeze by.  To the south the crack
appears to widen slightly.

   This is a small dry cave that has been carved from the living rock.  Some
dilapidated furniture has been spread about the room, and the floor is littered
with debris and old, gnawed bones - human bones.
