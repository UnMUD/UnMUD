Entrance to St. James Park^
   You are standing at the entrance to St. James Park.  Set in the middle
of London, very close to Westminster Abbey, the park is a refreshing change
from the dirt and bustle of the city itself.  The park stretches out to the
west and consists of many green lawns, a pond spanned by a single bridge,
and two stone paths; one on either side of the pond.  To the north is the
pond, to the south are the green lawns, and way ahead to the west you can
just make out the back wings of Buckingham Palace.  Outside the park to the 
south is the Abbey.

   You are on a beautiful green lawn just north of the main park entrance.
To the northwest is a pond full of cool and clear water.  To the south is
an enormous open grassy area with a number of large shade trees.

The Edge of the Pond^
   The beautiful lawn on which you are treading meets with a pond just to
the west.  It looks as if the section of the pond nearest you has been
marked off for wading.  Perhaps it would feel good to dangle your feet
in the cool water for a little while.

The Edge of the Pond^
   The pond that dominates the park meets with the lawn upon which you are
standing, just to the west.  It looks as if the section of the pond nearest
you has been marked off for wading.  Perhaps it would feel good to dangle
your feet in the cool water for a little while.  From where you stand, you
notice that there is a second path through the park just to the north of
the pond.

Entrance to St. James Park^
   You are now at the northern entrance to St. James Park.  There is 
another entrance to the south of you, beyond a pond.  There is also a
northern entrance at the western edge of the park, over where you can
just make out the back wings of Buckingham Palace in the distance.  The
path you are on leads to the western entrance, past a pond to the south.

St. James Park^
   You are north of the northern path through St. James Park.  To the south
you see a pond, beyond which lies a large expanse of beautiful green
grass.  The park is a welcome change to the hustle and bustle of the city.
The lawns are well-manicured and the pond looks cool and clear.

St. James Park^
   You are on the northernmost edge of the park, just north of the northern

the west you can see a bridge that spans the pond to join with another
path on the southern side.

Path Through St. James Park^
   You are on the northern east-west path through the park.  The northern
entrance is to the east, and the park stretches out to the west.  To the 
south of you is the wading area of the pond.  Beyond it is a large fountain,
and you can make out a grassy area opposite the pond.

The Wading Area^
   Moving through the wading area, trying not to get your rolled-up pants
too wet, you realize how good the water feels to your feet.  You dip your
arms in and cool your wrists.  You then scoop up a little water in your
hands and put it on the back of your neck.  The water is rejuvinating,
and suddenly you feel refreshed.  To the west of you the water continues,
but a rope line keeps you from wading into that area.  You can, however,
canoe around the pond if you can find a boat along the shore.

The Wading Area^
   Moving through the wading area, the water is refreshing.  Feeling a 
bit frisky, you splash a nearby child.  He looks at you pathetically and 
goes quickly back to the edge of the pond.  To the west of you, the pond
continues, but a rope line keeps you from wading into that area.

The Edge of the Pond^
   You are next to the wading area of the pond.  The water looks inviting.
Hours of walking through the city of London have made you feel weary and
dirty.  Perhaps a quick dip in the water would be refreshing.

Path Through St. James Park^
   You are standing west of the main entrance to St. James Park.  The park
stretches out to the west and consists of many green lawns, a pond, fountains,
and two stone paths.  To the north is the pond, to the south the green lawns,
and way ahead to the west you can just make out the back wings of Buckingham
Palace.  The path is lined on both sides by green park benches.

St. James Park^
   Rising up next to you is a large shade tree.  Its branches fan out above
you, providing shade from the summer sun.  To the north you can see a large
fountain in the pond, spitting water up into the air with magnificent
grace.  Through the trees to the west you can just barely make out the
back of Buckingham Palace.

St. James Park^
   You are southeast of the main park entrance, against the southern
fence.  The city lies beyond it, but for now you are so taken with the
park that you do not wish to go back out into it.  It amazes you how 
such a clean and beautiful place can exist in such a large and dirty city.

Pathway Through St. James Park^
   You are on an east-west path through St. James Park.  To the east is the
park entrance, and to the west is the expanse of the park.  The park ends
to the west where it joins with the gardens of Buckingham Palace.  To the 
north is a pond with a large fountain in it, and to the south is a huge 
grassy place speckled with trees and people.  The path is lined on both
sides by green park benches.

The Edge of the Pond^
   Standing on the edge of the pond, the glorious fountain is straight
ahead of you.  The water it tosses into the air is clean and clear and
looks very refreshing on this hot day.  The grass you are standing on is
perfectly manicured.  To the northwest is a small island in the water.  It
looks as though there are a few boats lying around on the shore that you 
could take if you felt like canoeing.

In the Fountain^
   Oops... you seem to have steered your canoe into the park's fountain.
Luckily, the only damage you seem to have done is to completely soak 
yourself.  Now your troubles lie in trying to get your boat free of the
strong current pulling you toward the fountain base.
^
18 s:17 w:23 n:19;
lflags { Outdoors Peaceful OnWater }
On the Pond^
   You steer your boat to the northern side of the pond.  You are just east
of the island just north of the fountain. You feel little specks of water
landing on you from the fountain, but you are not getting all that wet.  The 
water feels good in the heat of the summer.

Path Through St. James Park^
   You are on the northern east-west path through St. James Park.  To the
east is the northern park entrance, and to the west is the expanse of the
park.  The park meets Buckingham Palace to the west.  To the south is a

area.  You can just make out the palace through the trees to the west.

St. James Park^
   You are along the northern area of the park.  To the north of here is
a large street which goes to Buckingham Palace.  There are many people
walking along the street, and you notice that, in contrast to the rest of
the city, no one walking there is in any hurry.  To the south is a beautiful
pond with a fountain in it.  There is a bridge over the pond.  The whole
park is very beautiful and serves as a relaxing change from the city.

Path Through St. James Park^
   You are on the northern east-west path through the park.  To the south of
the pond you can make out another path, accessible via a bridge that spans
the middle of the pond just off to the southwest.  To the west is Buckingham
Palace, while to the east is the park entrance with the city beyond.  On the
south side of the pond is a large grassy area.
^
23 n:22 s:24 w:37 e:18;
lflags { Outdoors Peaceful }
On the Island^
   Your boat has reached a little island in the pond.  Somehow, the grass
here is cut and as well-manicured as the rest of the park.  The grounds
crew must have an easier way over than yours.  You disembark to enjoy some
quiet time in the sun.

lflags { Outdoors Peaceful OnWater }
On the Pond^
  Drifting near the fountain, you get a good view of its set up.  There are
many jets tossing water into the air, forming a striking pattern in the
air.  You feel a little mist from the fountain landing on you, but you are
not really getting wet.  In fact, the mist feels good on this hot day.
^
25 n:24 w:39 s:26 e:16;

now, spitting its water into the air with impeccable grace.

St. James Park^
   You are in the southern area of the park, surrounded by tall shade trees.
Many of the trees have people sitting under them, protecting themselves from

the hour and wonder how long you have been in the park.

   Traveling along the northern edge of the park, you study the people
walking on the street.  They are all headed toward the palace, and most
