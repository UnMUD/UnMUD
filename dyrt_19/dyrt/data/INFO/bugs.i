Reporting bugs is very important.  It is impossible for a few people to
catch them all.  The more people working on them at a time, the more likely
we are to find them.  Reporting a crash bug to a developer is worth  5000
points for mortals and 3000 levels for immortals.  Minor bugs that do not 
crash the mud but which are annoyances are worth 3000 points for mortals
or 1000 levels for immortals.
