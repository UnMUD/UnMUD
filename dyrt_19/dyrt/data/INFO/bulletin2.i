		       ----- Bulletin for Wizards -----


The uaf file has been restrored!  Except for the people who were logged
on at the time of the bad reboot, all characters seem to be OK.
I guess if they aren't, we can take them one case at a time.
Some people may complain about the fact that the uaf file is a couple
days old, but that can also be updated.
