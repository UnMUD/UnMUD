Fixing the mud up cosmetically is something that people who do not understand
code and who do not want to contiribute time to writing a zone can easily do.
If you see a spot that needs color, tell us what command you would like to
see colored and mail the suggestion of what color(s) to use and we will
insert them into the code.  Also, if there are commands which send back an
error message or regular message that you would like to see changed, you 
may mail in those suggestions.  Same goes for actions.  You may either submit
changes to existing actions or write new ones.  Each cosmetic change is worth
50 levels to an immortal or 5000 points to a mortal.
