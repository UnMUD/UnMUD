stone and a feather of the sacred Quetzalbird, brought from a hermit 
living at the Tropic of Cancer to move this holy item.

grounds lie to the west, where a haze of yellow brilliance arises, and to

envelops the air around you, obscuring the surroundings and making the
rocks here slippery to the touch, but you can discern footholds safe enough
to climb up the face of the cliff, and a slightly (but not by much) safer

the ground here consists of hard rocks and pebbles that have fallen down
from a nearby gully up the cliff, making it hard for plants to root in.  A
path hugs the cliff, but still uncomfortably close to the swamps to the
east, which for some strange reason makes your skin crawl.  A break in the
twisted trees lie to the south, and it looks as if you could scrabble
through the pebbles up the side of the escarpment.

but a more promising path lies upwards to the east, where there appears to

plant growth, you feel some dreadfully evil influence has been the cause of
this.  In the face of the cliff here is recessed a cave, where within, you
can only discern blackness, though you spy some boot prints leading in and
out of the cave, evidence that someone resides here.  A smell emanates from
the cave, reminding you of some old stale bread and musty animal skins.  To
the east and west, the path continues to thread its way along the base of
the cliff.  Looking again into the swamp, as if your eyes are drawn there,
you spy a glimmer of gold in the dark murk, but before you can blink to
clear your vision, the bright spot is gone.  The path leads off at a
descending slope to the east and west, and a smaller trail leads south,

in by a perimeter of sharp rocks, supposedly brought in some time in the
past to break the tortuous waves beyond, and it in effect creates a calm
lagoon.  You see a tall cliff loom up from the north, the beach leading up
to a sharp west-north bend.  A bleak-looking stream lets out a little ways
to the south, just north of a line of more tide-breaking stones.

those that are brave and staunch enough to venture further.  You hear
strange sounds coming from inside the swamp, making your blood cold.  The
stream here smells fetid and vile, as if foul substances were dumped into
it.  You would feel much more comfortable if you headed back east along the
stream.

Beside the Stream^
	Walking on a grassy bank, you peer into an east-west running stream
as it drains out of a dreary looking swamp to the west.  The water, instead
of containing the vibrant life of plants and water life, bears the smelly
slimes, fetid algae, and uncleanliness of whatever dwells from within the
dark swamp, causing your nose to wrinkle.  The stream looks no more than
waist-deep, but any travel to the south bank appears futile, with a
formidable wall of thorny bramble bushes to meet you there.  More hopeful
paths lie to the east, where the stream thins out into the sea, and to the
north across a grassy field.  To the west, you see another, less traveled
path following the stream toward the edge of the swamp itself.  Such
feelings leave you to think that traveling into the swamp would not be a
good idea.

Mouth of the Stream^
	At this part of the beach, you see a stream come in from the west and
empty its dark and rancid waters into the sea, and you get a strange
feeling that the waters of the sea feel repulsed at what is emptying into
it from the stream.  Few if any plants seem to conglomerate at the stream's
edge, and how sickly and twisted the ones are that live there.  You can
follow the shoreline to the north, to a more welcoming beach, or follow the
stream to the west, or you can try crossing the stream here and approach a
line of wave-breaking rocks that lie nearby to the south.

In the Brambles^
	You are beating your way through a dense clump of thorny foliage, and
think that this was not really the best idea, since the plants seem to have
a mind of their own and appear to tear into your exposed flesh whenever you
think you've moved it out of the way, or prick you in the most sensitive
areas.  Safer ways of travel lie to the east and south, but to the north
and east, you might just be able to escape the thorny overgrowth by
plunging on through headlong.

On the Rocks^
	You carefully pick your way among large boulders lined in an east-
west line, going out about forty feet from the shore, obviously built by
past inhabitants to break the dangerous waves that come into the beach.
From here, you can see paths following the beach to the north and south,
and you can go inland by walking west toward a patch of thorny brambles, or
by following a steep path up a sandy dune.  If you are careful, you can
make your way east out to the end of the rocks.

nearby.  Waves crash around the rocks here, spraying them and you with cold
water, and making the rocks increasingly slippery, making even walking a
telling task, let alone anything more theatrical.  To the north you spy
another row of rocks, and to the south, you see a small dock jut into the
water.  The only survivable way out of here appears to be back along the
wet rocks to the west.

breakers fail to cover, and apparently on a sand shoal resting some hundred
feet from shore as well.  From this vantage, you spy to the north a long
wall of cliffs, and in front of that to the west, a dark green-black mass
that is only known as the Swamps of Peril.  To the south, you observe a
long beach leading back to a small set of docks.  The sides of the dunes
appear too steep to climb back down except for the west side and a quick
tumble down toward a line of wave breaking rocks.

north and a small boating dock to the south.  It seems that the water waves
are breaking too far from the shore than normal, hinting at a sand shoal to
the east, but you are not sure if you could reach it.  More accessible
routes appear to lie back toward the shore and farther south along the
shallows.

impossible since the water appears somewhat shallow.

blows in from the sea, tinged with salt.  Gulls and other sea-faring birds
fly overhead, circling and turning in some strange dance of the sea.  Not
too far away to the south, you spy a jetty poking its way into the wavy
waters.  Noticing the shallow waves, you see the cause in the form of a
sand shoal to the east.  Unfortunately, the water gets too deep before you
could get to it without special means.  Looking for exits, you see a way
back to the beach to the west, and it also seems possible to walk north,
following the shallow waters.

Dreamer's Point^
	This is the famous point of that man, the Dreamer, who made this high
corner of the cliff the popular place that it is.  From here, you can see
for miles around.  To the east and running along toward the south as far as
the eye can see, the great sea stretches out to the horizon, its blue
waters drawing your eyes hypnotically.  You see islands out in the distant
water, but can only imagine what they are like.  To the south you see a
flat lowlands, dominated by a dark mass of trees, the Swamps of Peril.
Outlining the swamp is a long beach, running up to the cliff foot directly
under you, and then splitting off, one trail continuing north up the beach,
and the other disappearing out of view to the west.  A range of mountains
line the valley far to the west and southwest, and nestled in front of the
range directly to the west is an old and eroding castle, with one black
tower still defiantly standing.  A path leading north is the only way out
of this narrow cliff corner.

fish and marine life being washed along by the waves, and some larger
aquatic denizens making waves of their own.  The water appears too
treacherous and deep in all directions save to the south.

east of the shoreline.  Looking at the ankle-deep water here, you discover
that the waves are broken somewhat by the shoal, since you are only swaying
in your steps at each wave instead of floundering head over heels.  The
water is noticeably colder here, giving hint that any traveling farther
east would not only be dangerous due to the waves and sea creatures, but
also to the exposure of the cold water.  You can follow the shoal to the
north and south, or back to toward the west, since the water looks much
shallower here.

in all directions but north, the water is too deep to safely traverse
without aid, and even then, the waters to the west look impossibly
traversable.  You feel something slimy and smooth brush your leg, and it
makes you start thinking that staying longer might not be the best of
survival instincts.

hopelessly cannot find anything in reach,  showing you that this pit was

animals are here, but all starved to death.  Obviously the last time that

ruined this forest may still be around!
   Although deeply disturbed by the destruction around you, you manage to look

the heavens, and simply pushed the trees down, in a line from West to East.
The few Oaks which still stand have been warped into unhealthy shapes, which
nature itself could never produce.  Following the line of downed trees, you

which grow around you. Even in the dim light, the brilliant hues of the
flowers - red, violet, blue, green, and white - stand out. Indeed, they glow
with their own light, providing the majority of the illumination in this room
and sending incredible, multi-colored shadows around the room. As you stare at
them, something tugs at your memory. You have seen that pattern somewhere
before... It is the pattern of the stars in the night sky, but of a color and
brightness that the night sky can only hint at.
   As your eyes slowly refocus on the mundane plane, you notice a wooden

   You have no doubt in your mind that the stairs in the middle of this room
must go down to hell itself.  If you thought the earlier rooms were hot, you
were obviously sadly mistaken.  Here, every breath you take burns your lungs.
Your skin is already beginning to blister from the intense heat, and you are
worried that your clothing may spontaneously combust!  As well, flames appear
in the corners of this room and the smell of brimstone is so strong that it
makes you want to vomit immediately.  Surely, nothing but Hades itself could
lie in the Inferno below...

Hot Cavern^
   You stand in a huge, natural cavern.  It is not just hot, but rather
almost unbearable.  There certainly better be something valuable down here
to make all of your suffering okay!  To the south of you is another natural
cavern, while to the east lies a passage which is obviously manmade.  Just
to the west is a stone door, set in the wall of the cavern.  A diamond shaped
hole lies in the center of the stone.

   You have entered what could only be a demonic museum.  All about you are
statues and paintings, most of which are quite grotesque.  You see sculptures
of demons torturing humans in many gruesome ways, as well as paintings of what
must be Hades.  The whole site is quite sickening.  Doors lead North, East and
South into additional museum rooms, while to the west lies the exit to this
perverted place.

the area shown in the mosaic is that which mortals call the wasteland.  You see
images of fire, a sword of awesome power, crystal flame and a great djinni.
For a moment, you almost become lost in the awesome vision.
   Flaming red letters in the center of the room spell out the words, HOME,
SWEET, HOME.

be valuable to sacrifice to the gods.  You are almost drawn by a morbid

this awful place lies to the North.

   You are quite delighted to find that this cavern is much cooler than the
surrounding ones.  In fact, the change in temperature is so dramatic that
you begin to shiver uncontrollably.  All about this room are various types of
fungus.  You can make out familiar Toadstools and Mushrooms.  In addition, you
see more much exotic fungus that you have never encountered before.  Perhaps,
you think, you are the only mortal to ever have ventured this far into the
earth. Other natural caverns lie to the North and South.

an enemy of the demon lord here is made quite clear by the voice you hear

water itself is unable to remain in its liquid form!  Surely, you must escape

red rock that is common throughout the caves and the smell of sulphur, like
always, all but overwhelms you.  Still, your eyes keep returning to that
gruesome desk.  Looking for exits to this room, you find three.  They lie to

Shrine to She-Ra^
   A powerful golden sword is embedded in an anvil here.  A winged headdress 
sits at its base.  The Femmenazis like her because they know that she outshines 
He-Man anytime.  Besides... she's good-looking.

Shrine to Malefiscence^
   The smell of evil, ichorous incense fills this room.  In the smoky light you 
can just make out a spinning wheel in the corner.  Somehow you feel that you 
shouldn't go play with it, tho that feeling could stem from the fact that the 
Femmenazis would be very upset at you  for even considering doing any domestic 
work.  You do NOT want to upset a Femmenazi...

Calamity Jane was a great gunfighter in the American Old West.  Why she felt 
she had to disguise herself as a man no Femmenazi will ever understand.  But 
none the less... they liked her.

   Probably one of the favorite Femmenazi heroines of all time... the Siren.  
She would lull men to a rocky isle with her voice, where they would drown; 
their boats destroyed on the rocks.  She killed a good many men in her day... 
and caused a lot of ego-downers.

and they are stretched over a small, but very fast-flowing river out of sight
to the southwest.  A very fast-flowing river emerges out of the dam wall a 
couple of yards west of you and disappears out of sight into southern parts of
the cavern.  There is no way of following the river southwards or crossing it.
Sparks jump now and then from lots of tiny cords which hang down from the 
three power lines, thus enlightening the place in a strange blue and green light.
Th The place is surely in lack of maintenance, so you would better get
out of here.  It can be done by climbing a flight of stairs which is
cut out in the side of the wall.

Let's say it is a bank.
The bank is actually not another cave, but it is built in a large cave,

the fine gold inlay in the massive pillars the whole room resembles
something like a temple raised for a highheld god.
Right to the north is the tellers' room and that's where you may
withdraw spare money or let the bank take care of them.
In the south wall of this stunning room there is the main entrance to

Chairmans Office^
It is clear from the size both the room and its contents that this must
be the chairman's office.  The room measuring about 10 times 8 yards
contains nothing of excess, but the stuff that has been placed here
is of extraordinary quality and must surely have costed many a tellers
wages.  Right in front of you completely dominating the room is a large
mahogany desk which is one of the bigger you have seen.  Right behind it
placed up to the wall is a cupboard which in quality and splendor must
have been made by Chippendale himself.  More discretely in one corner
an inviting sitting-group almost begs you to take a seat.
To the south an opening leads into the tellers' room.

Dark and Drafty Chamber^
You have entered a dark and drafty chamber.  The draft is not that
strong here, but that is because this chamber is much bigger than the
narrow tunnel you used to get here.
This chamber is nearly pitch dark, but a few sunbeams manage to get
through a crystal grating in the ceiling.  The grating is just
reachable but the size of it prevents you from climbing through it when opened.
Worth noticing are the extremely dark walls of this chamber.  It is as
if they are made of light-absorbing material.
There is an exit to the south and another exit into a pitch dark
chamber to the east.

The Drawbridge^
     Every good castle has a drawbridge.  The thing about this one that jump out
at you immediately though is that under it there isn't a moat, as a matter of
fact, there isn't anything.  Looking down all you see are mountain tops.  Better
not fall off of this one.

The Courtyard^
     This is a gigantic courtyard.  Not only is the place almost a mile across,
but everything is HUGE!  The path you are standing on is paved with cobblestones
almost the size of things that you seem to remember being called Cadillacs, and
the flowers that fringe the edges are as large as small trees.  From the north
you hear a loud roar that sounds like a waterfall and to the south you see what
must be the garden, but it looks like a rain forest to you.  The drawbridge is
back to the west and the door to this gigantic castle is to the east.

splashing water feels almost like rain, even though, here above the clouds, the
sun is always out.  If you stand on your tippie-toes you can just reach the top

   You are standing at the bottom of a huge open pit.  The pit walls are
almost sheer, and well beyond climbing.  A narrow tunnel leads south

Entrance to the Professor's House^
   You have entered a charming and large old house.  The house is not in the
best of upkeep, but it is charming just the same.  As you enter, you can hear
the floors creak under your feet.  You peer around the corners into the other
rooms on this floor, and a sense of wonder overcomes you.  This house seems
full of mystery and enchantment, of a type you can not explain.  For some
reason you feel an uncontrollable urge to explore.

The Old Staircase^
   You are standing on an old staircase that reaches up  to the second floor.
Each step creaks and gives a little under your weight, but the stairs seem
very solid.  Straight ahead of you at the top off the stairs, you can look 
into a room that is painted a curious green colour.  You can see light coming
from the hall that seems to indicate open doors of some sort, although you
are not yet far enough up the stairs to see the source.

further damaging the floor.  Covering the drysink are all sorts of papers
that look like they are probably important to the Professor.  You do not

more years than you have been alive.  They are all functional, however.
The air in the kitchen is warm and smells of chocolate.  You look around
hungrily for whatever was made.

obviously aren't used very often, as there is no light here.  The stairs
themselves are free of dust and objects, but you still get the idea that
they aren't used much.  The stairs are very loud under your feet.  At
first the darkness is such that you can't see well, but your eyes adjust
and the further up you go, the more light that is provided by the room
above.

   You are now standing in the library of this large house.  There is an
impressive number of books here, all musty and covered with dust from age.
The books are well-worn and are obviously very treasured by the owner.
The Professor merely seems to have very poor house-cleaning skills and he
wouldn't dream of letting the maids near his library.  This room seems
to be where the Professor spends most of his time.

wall is a fireplace, which makes a great decoration.  However it seems like
it hasn't been used in years.

leaves on the trees are big and green.  There is a small stream running
somewhere nearby.  The large open lawn looks healthy and green.  You look
into the woods and ponder all of the interesting adventures that could
probably be had out there.

snow.  The thin trail continues to the east and to the south, the snow much

forces is even stronger now, but you still cannot find its source.
The hall turns corners to the north and south.

    The center of the chamber is dominated by a crystalline fountain that
is carved with intricate runes. The air is sweet, and it is hard to remember
that you are in a closed chamber. The fountain itself hums with immense

look closer they seem perfectly normal. The walls are windowless and made
of perfectly smooth polished stone. The hallway turns a corner to both the

floor beneath you rises and falls as if it were an ocean, and the walls shift
in liquid, flowing patterns. The noise is much stronger here, and an
ethereal light spills out of the northern chamber. The hall turns a corner

Fire and Ice^
    Amazingly, in this room fire and ice flow together, covering the walls
and creating a living, moving sculpture in the center of the chamber. You
gaze at it briefly, but when you look away it is several hours later. Time
means nothing in this room. To the north there is a smooth stone hallway,
and to the south there is a terrific wind, and you see what appears to be
a contained tornado.

   As you step into the entrance hall, the stone dragons bellow in anger and 
chase after you. You run ahead of them, terror in your heart. One spreads its 
stone wings and flies ahead of you. You are trapped between the two of them. 
The last sight you see is them approaching you.

    The floor of the clearing is lined with pure white sand, and the
air throbs with immense stored magical energy. Time seems to pass in a
blur: Flowers sprout beneath your feet and die off again in seconds.
You feel a strange sensation on your legs and when you look down there
is a large ivy twining itself around your calfs. Paths lead off in all
directions. To the south, east, and west thin trails lead through lush
green forest, and to the north lies a huge forest of living crystal.

   As you pass beneath the majestic crystal trees, a gust of wind blows 
through the top branches. There is a tremendous crack, and as you gaze up in 
horror a huge crystal branch crashes through the thinner boughs.  You run as 
fast as possible, and throw yourself to the ground. The huge branch misses 
you, but when it strikes the ground it shatters into thousands of needle sharp 
shards. Almost is slow motion, several pieces fly at you, and the last thing 
you see is the sunlight glinting through them in beautiful rainbow patterns.

see the rocky lands continuing far out of sight.  To the north the desert turns
into thick thorny bushes.

   You stop for a moment to have a look around as you trudge through the

come soon.  You find yourself desperately trying to distinguish reality from
mirage.  You think you see paths leading in every direction.  To the south
you can narrowly make out a red hill breaking the horizon.

a tall, thorny cactus.  You kick off your shoes and let the heat dry your
sweating toes.  Weak winds from the east blow gently through your hair and
the sweat on your shirt slowly evaporates, cooling down your back.  You glance
at the eastern skyline, which seems to be broken by odd structures in the 
distance.  Paths lead east and west.

 To the north you notice a small hut, and to the west the forest continues.  
The section of forest to the west seems to be made up almost entirely of very 
large oak trees.

Inside the Hut^
	You have entered a small hut.  The structure is falling down and is 
badly in need of maintenance.  There are holes in the wood that make up that 
walls, which allow for some light to get through.  On the floor you notice a 
small green object that seems to be wilting away.  You wonder what it is and 
how it got there.

look around and see that this is a simple storage area which the owner of this 
hut must have once used to keep his gardening tools.

the ring is the largest oak tree you have ever seen.  You stare up at it with a

move around.  The room you are in is not very large, and there are a few
doors that seem to lead to meeting rooms.  The building looks like the 
type of place where a town council would hold its meetings.  Off to one
corner is a long wooden table where many people can sit.  The floor around
it is well-worn and you guess that this building gets a lot of use.

crawling here and there, but they seem to be the only form of life that has
seen this place in many many years.  There is nothing particularly special
about the room.  It is carved into the hillside and was probably used
as a secret storage place long ago for pirated goods.  Way off to one corner

you press your hands and feet against opposite walls and work your way
down into the well about 7 feet.  You take your left foot one more step
down, and suddenly the well isn't so dry anymore.  You lose your footing
on some slime and fall into the well below.

of people who, from their shyness, you guess aren't from around here.

The Village Road^
   You have reached the northern end of this street.  Beyond, to the north,
there is a river bank, and beyond, a large prairie filled with nothing but
tall grass.  On the other side, in the distance, you can see some incredibly
large mountains.  They seem to be at their most impressive off to the 
north-east.  
   To the west is the locksmith's and to the east is the General Store.
The main part of the village is back to the south.

   Here, the locksmith makes keys and locks for anyone who wants one.  The
smith himself seems to be at work on a particular key behind the counter.
All around you are examples of his work, including a huge key hanging on
one of the walls that seems a bit frivolous, but perhaps it serves some 
purpose of which you are not yet aware.

imported little items such as dolls and toys.

   The stream you are standing by could more likely be considered a small 
river.  The water is moving quite fast, and you feel that it would probably
be unwise to attempt to cross it.  The stream seems to flow from the

is teeming with life of all kinds.  The sun above is shining bright and
reflecting off of the river's water.  The noise you hear coming from the

   Beyond you to the west is one of the most breath-taking sights you have
ever seen.  Here the river gets white and foamy as it cascades down a
waterfall.  Hitting the river below with tremendous force, the whole area
is alive with the sound of flowing water.  Not too far away this rushing
water joins the open sea in an eroded inlet.  There is a rocky path leading
down dangerously close to the waterfall.

Monument^
   You are in a small square of some kind, with a large granite monument in
front of you.  Its grey surface has a dull luster to it, and you see some 
runes etched into its side.  To the south you spy a small white church, and
to the east is a small alleyway, leading into darkness.

   You are in a small alley.  The street continues off to the west, towards the
center of town, and ends in a wall to the east.  Off to the south you see a    
parsonage to a church.  There are some containers of garbage here, but the    
contents have been partially consumed by something.  Your nose curls from the

Cemetery^
   The cemetery is a small, private lot.  A few marble headstones mark the 
resting place of some of the town's former residents.  Tufts of grass are
growing here and there, but otherwise the ground is barren.  A small breeze
blows past, stirring the dust up a bit.  One tombstone reads, "Here lies
George Pratt.  He missed the cliff, now he's flat."

Rotting Church^
   You find yourself inside an old church.  Overturned pews, smashed windows,
and graffiti on the walls show that it has been vandalized.  The altar remains
intact, however, but the linens have been removed long ago.  Off to the west
you see a small picket fence, and some gravestones.  To the east is a
parsonage.  With a bit of deduction, you realize that the parsonage must be for
this church.

the Hohenzollern family was well-respected, but seemed to have run into
problems with a dragon that Parsifal had tried to tame.  Nothing had been heard
from the family since, and no one ever successfully returned from their castle.

out of a hole in the wall above you, and continues down through the grass into
the valley below.

busily scuttle around, filling the orders of the patrons within.  A

    The dirt path is surrounded by thick bushes, and has clearly been made
for some purpose. Just ahead, the bushes suddenly stop, and as you approach,
you gasp, almost walking right off a cliff. They really should warn people 
about that shouldn't they. The sudden drop has forced who ever made this path
to turn northward in their journey.

Alpine way^
    Winding it's way though this great mountain range, this path heads
southward toward what looks like a safer place to be; a nice grassy patch
of earth further on, by a river looks most inviting, and well looked after.
Ideal for a picnic perhaps. A few tall trees grow here, and gradually become 
thicker to the north, as the path through this range climbs a little further.

Lost in the mountains^
    Well you are not exactly lost, though you don't quit know where you are.
The village and the church are so far away now, but the one thing you have
in your favor for finding your way out, is this trail. The mountains all
round, closing you in, provide a natural path to follow, the only one possible
at this point. There is a small landslide ahead, but you can easily climb up.

Cliff edge^
    A solid rock ledge extends out past the last tree, sitting high
above a valley below. The dead trees and other vegetation here, seem to have
died for no reason, at least none that is visible; below in the valley
large parts of the forest have suffered in a similar way.
    A gust of wind blows you forward, toward the edge of the cliff, but
you are able to regain your balance; below you note the large fall, and
hard rocky surface. The winds here gust so much, even with a way to fly down
jumping would be crazy. Small paths wind their way through the valley below,
walked quite a lot from the looks of it. Following one heading east, a
small temple has been contructed on a mound and there is a tower someways
south east of that. Looking directly down, there is some movement outside
what looks like a cave leading into the very mountain on which you are
standing.

plenty of space for everyone to move around as well as take notes and memos.
It seems like the wood is very old, but it has been beautifully restored and
polished.  You can feel that many important decisions have been made around
this table for many centuries.  The chairs that surround the table are silver

classified as 'modern.'  You can still smell the carpet, which is a warm,
toasty brown.  The house is generally tidy, but you feel that, given Rex's
nature, there are probably a few rooms and secluded places here that must be
very messy.  The apartment is very comfortable and you grin evilly and 
consider taking a self-guided tour.

that criss-cross the ceiling.  Papers are grouped into piles on the desk,
in an attempt to make it look tidy.  On the desk sits a very sophisticated

work spaces, but other than that there is very little that resembles
furniture in here.  The more furniture one has in a darkroom, the better
the chances of falling over something.  There are three trays of liquid
on one of the counters.  One of them is emitting a quasi-nasty smell.
Hanging on a line on one side of the room are several rolls of black
and white film.  On shelves all around the room are lots of bottles of
different chemicals.  They all look a little scary to you.  Against one
wall is a large sink.  Behind the sink on pegboard there are several pairs
of forceps, a thermometer, a rubber tube, a squeegie, and a few other
photography tools.

   You have stepped out of Rex's room onto a large balcony.  There is an
over hang built onto it to keep you dry in the rain, but it only covers half of
the balcony, so that you can also watch the stars on clear nights.  There is an
intricate railing that will block you from falling.  As you look beyond the
railing you look into a deep valley that is perfectly green.  The land looks
like a meadow.  Way beyond that valley are tall, majestic mountains.  The whole
view gives you a feeling of complete and utter calm.  The breeze you feel is
surprisingly warm.  The balcony is perfect for spending time with someone you
love, or simply curling up with a book or watching the stars at night.

   This is the place where only Rex's friends are invited to.  Hidden in a
group of old beech trees, a small grassy clearing opens up before you filled
with sun and warmth.  Some fruit trees shade the garden from above, inviting
you to lie down under them and listen to the soft whispering of the breeze
through their branches.  There are some tiny mystical creatures called
wuselchen wuseling busily around in the grass, just out of your reach.
   To the east is a crystal clear pool, sparkling in the sunlight.  One edge is
covered with beautiful water lilies, while the trunk of a birch reaches far 
over the water, allowing you to rest comfortably on it.

The tree overhead and the surrounding groves provide for complete privacy here.
With a little bit of effort, you can dive through an underground waterway to
reach other pools to the north and south.

On the Island^

here is cut and as well-manicured as the rest of the park.  The grounds
crew must have an easier way over than yours.  You disembark to enjoy some
quiet time in the sun.

   You are in a large rocky and very uneven cave.  A smooth path has been cut
across the floor permitting easy walking.  The whole cave is filled with a
thundering roar which reaches deep into your mind.  A huge, deep and steep-
walled channel full of lava prevents you from going east through a huge
gateway.

The Hall Of Fire^
   You are in the hall of fire.  The very walls are tinged with a fiery
radiance, as if the rock itself is burning.  A red pentacle is near one wall
beside a picture carved in the wall.  A lever on one wall is beside a huge
metal drawbridge.  A passage leads east.

Large Damp Cave^
   You are in a large cave.  The cave echoes to the dripping of water from its
cold damp roof, thickly coated in algae and mosses.  A pillared hall stretches
off the the east, and a rocky canyon goes west.

Low, Rough Passage^

escape route of some form.  A sign hanging on the wall reads in a rather crude

The Temple^
   You are in a sinister temple.  Hideous shapes seem to reach out of nothing-
ness towards you and vanish as immaterial shadows.  The whole room radiates a
crushing sense of power filling you with awe and dread.  A huge fire burns at
an end of the temple, seemingly without a source.  Doorways lead lead north
and east.

hut of some sort.

Sacred Clearing^
   You find yourself in a clearing deep in the Misty Mountains.  Some mighty
being has carved this niche out of the living rock, making the place 
suitable for the gods themselves to wed.  A simple podium in the center of
this clearing lends to the overall impression that this is a holy place.
   Stands have been hewn out of the mountain and intricately carved with an
animal motif.  Each of the 50 seats depicts a different creature, and all
appear calm and serene.  
   A feeling of peace and goodwill washes over you as you gaze in awe at 
the majestic peaks that surround this place.

The Happy Dwarf^
   The room you have just stepped into is the biggest bar you have ever seen
in your whole life. Dwarves, Elves, Halflings and Humans are all drinking
together, toasting the well-being of each race.  The room's atmosphere is
highlighted by a band of minstrels playing on stage.  On the stage is Marc
the Songlord with his mellow-sounding guitar and Tracelor, the Master of 
Music, playing his magical Songsword.  Standing behind the two of them is
the final member of this musical band, Warmack.  Warmack is wielding his
great tuba and is using it to provide the perfect amount of bass to make
the music both moving and entertaining.
  The bar itself is vast in size.  There is no trouble at all in finding a 
place to sit and relax from a hard day of makin' death or handling mortals.
On the walls of the bar are the words "Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia."  Let music
be a part of your life and bathe you within its vibrations.  The whole bar
is decorated in only three colors... Red, Black, and Gold.

The Meeting Room^
   You move from the bar into a smaller room off to the east.  There are 
several tables here which seem suitable for eating, drinking, or meeting.
There are sofas in one corner of the room for smaller and more intimate
conversations.  The entire meeting room is decorated in Red and White.
You notice a picture on the wall of the band playing away in the other room.
Next to it is a picture of several Human women who appear to make up a 
vocal group.  In large letters on one wall are the words "Sigma Alpha Iota."
On another wall there is a large crest with a large sword in it which catches
your eye.  The words "Vita Brevis Ars Longa" line the bottom of the crest.
The room itself is a bit quieter than the attached bar.  You can still hear
the music coming from the other room, but the noise level isn't nearly as 
rowdy.

In the Jailhouse^
   Welcome to Jail.  You must have done something pretty awful to get locked
up in here.  Hopefully you won't have to stay here for long, but someone
obviously feels that you have some cooling off to do.  Hopefully that
someone will be here soon to deal with you.  Otherwise, you could be stuck
here for a very long time...........
						Enjoy!
