VERY IMPORTANT:

some machines use Intel byte format (LSB, or DCBA), and some Non-intel
(MSB, or ABCD).. For example, Sun is MSB, and Concetrix is LSB.

What does this mean to you?

well, not much, except that the user files are not compatible between
a MSB and a LSB machine. You will need to have them either converted (see 
ntohl man pages) to the proper format, or start anew.


read the install.doc file for detailed info on configuring the game for
your machine.

gcc is the suggested compiler, although any ansi compiler should
work (concentrix version was compiled with its native compiler)
