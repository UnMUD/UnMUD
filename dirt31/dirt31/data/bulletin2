                     ----- Bulletin for Wizards -----

  Some thoughts on game Policy:

        As a wizard you have the freedom to do what you want to do.

        You deal with players the way you think is right, we don't have
        any explicit rules here, as opposed to other muds. We trust you
        with the privilieges you are given.

        We aren't interested in monitoring the wizard's actions and 
        don't log the use of snoop/heal etc, which most other muds do.

  If you have any questions about DIRT (which, from wiz-level and up,
  is a little different from other muds), feel free to ask the Gods.

  If the Wizards show interest in running Tournaments we will concider
  fixing the code in order to enable the wizards to start tournaments.
