TELL [player] [msg]    or    [player] [msg]
Allows you to tell a player something.  Although you really ought only
to be able to tell something to someone in the same room, we found the
game as a whole works better with TELL  as it is.  Similary, you could

simply many "Who's playing?" shouts.

You can specify an object to a command in several ways:
1) <object-name>
2) <object-name><number-in-sequence-with-that-name>

Example: If there are several rings in a room, "get ring3" would get the 3rd.

[X]CLONE <location/mobile/object> <optional new name>

[X]Examples: "clone puff The Big Red Dragon" or "clone home2 My New Home"
[X](In case a new mobile name contains spaces, its name in the game will be
[X] whatever word comes after the last space).
[X]
[X]The intended way of creating your unique room, mobile or object, is to
[X]clone something close to what you want, and then use the SET and CHANGE
[X]commands to forge it to exactly match your needs.
[X]
[X]All new creations will normally be destructed at RESET unless you have
[X]the power, by invoking the STORE command, to mark it as non-temporary.
[X]
[X]See also DESTRUCT, STORE, RESET       (and ROOM, MOBILE, OBJECT)
[X]^
[X]DESTRUCT <location/mobile/object>
[X]Destruct (remove from the game) something that was created with CLONE.

[X]LOAD <player-name>
[X]If not followed by any argument, it means your own zone.
[X]This command loads a zone stored with the STORE command from its saved
[X]state on disk and into the game.
[X](or parts of it, if some of the items are allready in the game.)
[X]
[X]It leaves everything that's not temporary (remember that anything you
[X]have created after the last invocation of STORE is only temporary)
[X]in their reset-state.
[X]A LOAD is normally done automaticly if your zone is not allready in the
[X]game when you enter.
[X]^
[X]STORE <player-name>
[X]If not followed by any argument, it means yourself.
[X]This command creates a zone for you, its name will be your characters name.
[X]It is not intended for making zones for mortals to adventure in,
[X]but it lets you build your own personal stuff with much more fun and ease
[X]then the traditional way of bugging your God do it for you.
[X]The STORE command does the following:
[X]
[X]- Marks all mobiles/locations/objects you have created (with CLONE) as non-
[X]  temporary, so that they will be reset on a reset instead of destructed.
[X]
[X]- Sets their reset-values to the exact state the mobiles/locations/objects
[X]  are in when the STORE command is issued. Your zone will be reset on every
[X]  reset to the exact state it was in, the last time you did a STORE.
[X]
[X]- Saves everything on disk, so that you may LOAD your zone at a later time.
[X]  Your zone will remain in the the game even after you quit,
[X]  but will go away if you don't come back within a certain period of time,
[X]  (currently 3 days). It will in any case be loaded again automatically the
[X]  next time you enter the game.     See also LOAD, CLONE, DESTRUCT, RESET
