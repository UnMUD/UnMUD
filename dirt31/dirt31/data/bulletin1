  I hereby proudly present the new single-process mud programmed from
  scratch by Alf and Nicknack.  Good work!                     - Root.

  The new ANCIENT and FROBOZZ zones are situated in the southern parts of the
  game, and offer you adventure, action, puzzle and score.

  Type "info dead" to see who are the most blood-thirsty or unlucky
  of the players and mobiles.
  
--> To you who also play other muds: beware of some mobiles wielding weapons
--> here. They are a little stronger. Also, note that you hit (and get hit)
--> once every 2 seconds, (and not 3), so be alert during fights!  -Nck
