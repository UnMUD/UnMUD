      DIRT-2      Changes & additions from DIRT-1  (Summer 1991)
 ===========================================================================

  DIRT-2 is essentially DIRT-1 but fine-tuned for speed and efficiency.

  The installation-procedure has been greatly simplified. The
  masteruser is generated automaticaly, with the correct level and flags,
  A new world-file is generated whenever needed and reset is done whenever
  needed. No more getting caught by the tree etc. when trying to get in
  for the first time.....
  The wizlist, the password file etc are generated automaticly too.

  The title-system has been changed. The titles are now contained in the
  player file along with the level, score etc. A side effect is the fact
  that each player has his own private title which is changable, the titles
  are no longer linked to your level. And so all wizards may very well be of
  the same level. The titles are contained in an in-game data structure,
  the one that is shared among processes, so there is no need for the
  game to read the  old title files every time you walk into a room and see
  another player.

  The size of the shared data area has been cut in half to double the speed
  if IPC using files has to be used.

  A bug fixed, to allow yet another doubling of speed if IPC by files has to
  be used.

  New commands:  I don't remember everthing at this time of writing (1992), but
  CHANGE NAME, CHANGE DAMAGE, CHANGE ARMOR, CHANGE SPEED are new with dirt-2.
  So are OPENGAME, and DELETE. 

  Lots of things are improved, like the 'stat player' showing which
  weapon (and damage), the armors (and protection) and the accumulated
  protection for the player.

  Parts of the old code has been cleaned up and made 'readable' :-). 
  The logging in and main-loop has been rewritten so that it's relatively
  easy to follow step by step.
