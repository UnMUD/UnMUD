 This file contains the development and changes that was made to AberMUD IV
==============================================================================
Brian Preble, rassilon@eddie.mit.edu; February, 1990

o  Increased number of pflags to 32.
o  Blind, Deaf, Dumb, and Crippled are now pflags.
o  ANSI Color!!!  May be used anywhere.
o  UNVEIL may now be used by anyone in kernel.h's wizlist.
o  Player's titles now contain %s where their name should go.
o  If DATA/guests exists, allow only users listed (reverse of banned)
o  DATA/reserved contains a list of players with reserved slots.
   A reserved slot is anything between current player maximum and MAXUSERS
==============================================================================
Brian Preble, rassilon@eddie.mit.edu; January, 1990

o  Created reserved slot for MASTERUSER.
o  If DATA/nologin exists, kick everyone off and pit treasure immediately.
o  Added NOARMS pflag, removes player's arms.
==============================================================================
Brian Preble, rassilon@eddie.mit.edu; December, 1989

o  Added NOARMS pflag, removes player's arms.
o  SETOUT now inserts direction where %s is found in string.
o  Replaced calls to rand() and srand() with random() and srandom()
o  Removed unused structure globaldata[].
o  Added player descriptions.
==============================================================================
Alf; December, 1989

o  Fixed problem with IN teleporting you to the room affected.
o  Added locations.h generation to generate.c.
o  Created sendsys.h to remove hard-coded message id's.
==============================================================================
klemets@sics.se; November, 1989

o  Added random combat messages to make combat more interesting.
==============================================================================
Dave Shewchun, anarchy@jabberwock.mit.edu; November, 1989

o  Locations may now be abbreviated.  Example: B84 = BLIZZARD 84
o  New show code for players and objects.
==============================================================================
Brian Preble, rassilon@eddie.mit.edu; November, 1989

o  Changed treasure value scheme (See ovalue() and tscale()).
o  WEBSTER command.  This is a call to the webster program, and will not work
   on all systems.
o  SPAWN and MAXUSERS command.
o  If a player comes in immediately after a crash, s/he will now be placed
   where they were, possessions intact.  (Barring theft by others, that is.)
o  Jumping into pits now cashes in your treasure.
o  Dropping containers into pits will give you points for their contents.
o  Added damage display to STATS of mobiles.
o  Added <lit> to inventory.
o  Created location flags.  See lflagnames.h and lflags.h
==============================================================================
Brian Preble, rassilon@eddie.mit.edu; October, 1989

o  More bug fixes.
o  The password file is now DES encrypted.
o  Split BLIZZARD into sub-regions (VILLAGE, ICECAVE, ...)
o  Object numbers may now be used in STATS and SHOW.
o  Added general diagnosis text to SCORE.
o  Merged object descriptions (examine.###) into "objects" file.
o  Added privacy code.  If the first character of a room's long description
   is "2", that room may only contain two people.
o  Removed hard-coded darkness routines.  Rooms are now considered dark if
   the first character of their long description is a percent (%).
o  Made FROST spell.
o  Turned sacrifice pits into objects for flexibility
o  Added use for sulphur (increase damage by fireballs)
o  Rewrote magic.c to simplify spell-casting routines.  Wrote castspell()
   and damagebyspell().
o  Fixed bug in parser which crashed the game if % was the first thing on a
   command line.
o  Created new section (CATACOMB).  Designed by Cedric.
==============================================================================
Brian Preble, rassilon@eddie.mit.edu; September, 1989

o  Created mobiles.h
o  Created new section (OAKTREE).  Author wishes to remain anonymous.
o  Mobiles code is now more generic.  For example, monster levels between
   -900 and -999 are undead, -100 to -299 are non-moving.  -1 to -199 never
   attack.  Probability of attack for other mobiles = level mod 100.
   Damage done is still hardcoded (see blood.c) but I'm working on it.
o  Removed hard-coded user limit.  Can now exceed 16.
o  Removed hard-coded armour code, created new object property OFL_ARMOUR,
   uses the "special" byte to set the percentage reduction on chance-to-hit.
o  Added ^W (delete word) to input routine, flushed typeahead buffer to
   prevent players from using the mouse buffer to fill up with "fireball him".
   Also prevents remote users from feeding files to the game.
o  New wizard command NOSHOUT prevents you from hearing shouts.
=============================================================================
Brian Preble, rassilon@eddie.mit.edu; August, 1989

o  Wrote yet another Makefile with dependencies and lint.
o  Cleaned up source code, made cosmetic changes to text.
o  Transfered the "action" commands (hug, kiss, scream, etc.) into an external
   database (DATA/actions).
o  Fixed MANY bugs.
o  Added HEAL, EMOTETO, ECHO, ECHOTO and ECHOALL.  Also many new actions.
o  Added code to allow wizards to GOTO <playername>.  Saves jumping around
   when tracking a moving target.  Also works with IN (see HELP AT).
o  Changed many hardcoded values into #define's (pflags & oflags most notabily)
o  Merged mud and mudprog into one file, thus cutting 45k off the total size.
o  Created a real HELP command that gives detailed help on commands.
o  HELP [person] now tells the helper what was done.
o  WHO no longer displays mobiles.  Use MWHO for that.
=============================================================================

  correct msgs.

============================================================
4 Jul 1989 by -om (makela@tukki.jyu.fi)

- Added <wielded> to inventory in addition to <worn>.
- Lotsa munging in generate to make header files objects.h
  and verbs.h so that these may be changed from the actual
  numbers in the source code...

============================================================
4 Jul 1989 by -jme (eloranta@tukki.jyu.fi)

- fixed a type in bprintf.c
- fixed few bugs in new1.c

Add special meanings (in dogiv()) for rose and umbrella.

Lots of bug fixes (here are some of them):

- username / passwd checks..
- line redraw... taken from the old version.
- light (isdark()) routine was incorrect.
- generate.c had problems in flags() and some where else (forgot where).
- One line was missing from DATAFILES/reset.txt.
- splitit() addressed block incorrectly (nam1 began from the controlword).
- look at fixed (problem with the parser?).
- Wiz commands such as: goto, stats, show etc. fixed.
- uaf.rand file access fixed (originally opened for 'r' but should have been
  opened for 'r+').

  infinite loop... but it somehow did..
- + some other minor bugs..

==============================================================================
Rich $alz, rsalz@bbn.com or rsalz@uunet.uu.net; February, 1989.

I wrote a real Makefile, cleaned up all the program generation stuff (it's all
in the file generate.c, called as needed from the Makefile).  Renamed the
drivers to be mud and mudprog instead of gamego, gmain2.

Edited all the documentation files and put it into one file formatted for the
-ms macros.

Added USE_MACROS for speed.

Linted the code, used typedefs.

Removed the ability to call BBOARD and CHAT programs.  This should either go
back in, so that Abermud can be used as a login program, or it should be
removed altogether and the front-end program should just be merged in.
[I merged the front-end program in. -- Rassilon]

Removed some dead code.

Created one header file with all config parameters, global variables, etc.
=============================================================================
Lorry:
	Added unveil (written mostly by Wraistlyn) into parse.c; format
	is UNVEIL level, it turns you into that level. Any player can use
	it but any use (fail or pass) is logged.

	Added BANG.

	Changed SAY so the bleedin thing doesn't repeat what you said when
	you have just seen what you are typing.

	Ported over the UCL Level table system for testing, it seems to
	work so, lets cross fingers till some poor novice turns into a
	dwarf!  The table is in .test/levels for another obscure reason
	that I'll never suss and format is:  level-num:female-lev:male-lev
	eg: 10001:the arch-witch:the arch-wizard
	Mobile names are in here too and, as the file is used every level
	reference, changing a level name has immediate effect.
	Mods in objsys.c

Tbag:
	Have changed the little bug (again) that allows wizzes to see
	where invis arches are, in peocom.  Also awizzes can force people
	to grope themselves and a few other things, but NOT quit, cos it
	causes problems with lockups. (locking in bprintf, I think).

        Attacking Chicken Licken now crushes mortals to death. Normal
        fight with Chicken Pie. Mods in blood.c

Anarchy:
	Added database to system, and table orientied code. Some changes
        to the internal logic too. Some commands MUST be used from databse
	any using error).

	Added promptlist boot file

	curch,my_lev etc are now obsolete DO NOT USE.  Should be able
	to use these functions with mobiles too, eg. TAKE and so on
	along with binding tables to mobiles.

	Numerous sundry game bugs fixed

	Classes added, currently primitive - more to come

	Second key, etc. stuff added

	Match() made more intelligent

	TELL now optional

	Wand in tower now does invisibility (temporary)

	Fixed unveil locking bug
