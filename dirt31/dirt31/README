            Information and Installation Guide for DIRT 3.1.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dirt (Abermud) is an adventure-style ("kill dwarf") game, except that 
multiple people can play at the same time.

The files doc/CHANGELOG-aber-IV and doc/Manual.ms contain changes and info for
the old original code, they are obsolescent and are included for historical
reasons only.

Dirt Authors:
Alf Salte (Alf) <salte@ifi.uio.no>, and G.Sorseth (Nicknack)
                                       <gjermund@ifi.uio.no>.

Other contributors are given credit in the data/credits file.


INSTALLATION
============
1. Edit the src/config.h file, and the 'GAMEDIR' in src/Makefile.

2. Type "make"

3. If any errors occur, fix them and continue at step 2 above.

5. run bin/restart  (a program that runs in the background and
                     restarts the game if it should crash and if it
                     uses too much cpu resources.

   The executable is bin/aberd (aberd = aber-daemon), it will be started
   by restart. (but you don't _have_ to use restart of course)


Examine the =README= file in the data directory to find out what the
various files that are there are for, and edit the the bulletins, etc... 
There is also a README file in the bin-directory.

Enter the game using your master-character, and mud is ready! 

aberd options:    -c          Clear the syslog file on startup.
                  -f          Run in the forground (for debugging)
                  -d<path>    The location of the data dir. Default = ../data
                  -p <port>   Specify port number. Default is 6715.
                  -k          Kill any other mud first if it's allready running
		  -v          Print version and exit.
                  -n <number> Maximum number of players. The default is 32.

bin/Dump is a utility for dumping the player-file in a readable format.
See the top lines of src/Dump.c for more info on usage.

3.0-3.1.c is a program that converts DIRT3.0 playerfiles to the DIRT3.1 format.
